# Computer Security Encryption Algorithms
 I developed scripts to encipher and decipher common encryption algorithms. 
 These scripts were created to automate the tedious calculations that go into encryption and decryption.
 
 Includes:
 Diffie Hellman
 El Gamal]
 KnapSack
 RSA - for confidentiality
 RSA - for integrity
 RSA - for both confidentiality and integrity
 Vigenere Cypher
 
 These scripts were developed in Python.
