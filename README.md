# Computer Security Encryption Algorithms
 I developed scripts to encipher and decipher common encryption algorithms. 
 These scripts were created to automate the tedious calculations that go into encryption and decryption.
 
 Includes:
 Diffie Hellman
 El Gamal]
 KnapSack
 RSA - for confidentiality
 RSA - for integrity
 RSA - for both confidentiality and integrity
 Vigenere Cypher
 
 These scripts were developed in Python.
 
 More work needs to be done to document how it can be used.
 However, someone who needs these scripts and knows the steps of these underlying algorithms can quickly figure out how it is used.
